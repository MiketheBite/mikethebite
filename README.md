# Hi there, IÂ´m Miguel ðŸ‘‹

I'm trying to give my life a boost by diving into a new programming challenge.

But I still have no idea what I'm doing!

### SummaryðŸ‘‹
- ðŸŒ± I'm Portuguese but I live in Germany. 
- ðŸ˜„ I'm a Pasteis de Nata lover but I don't miss a Weissbier with Weisswurst for breakfast!
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as a intensive care Nurse.
- ðŸ‘¯ I have plans to learn to program and would like to work as a programmer in scientific research or medicine. Something around that!
