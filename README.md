I'm trying to give my life a boost by diving into a new learning challenge.

But I still have no idea what I'm doing!

### SummaryðŸ‘‹
- ðŸŒ± I'm Portuguese but I live in Germany. 
- ðŸ˜„ I'm a Pasteis de Nata lover but I don't miss a Weissbier :beer: with Weisswurst for breakfast!:pretzel:	
- :running_shirt_with_sash:	I love sports, I usually swim and run with some frequency. But now I'm discovering Crossfit 
- :earth_africa:	I love to travel, the places where I liked going the most were Congo and Japan.
- :hospital: Iâ€™m currently working as a intensive care Nurse.
- ðŸ‘¯ I have plans to learn to program and would like to work as a programmer in scientific research or medicine digitalization. Something around that!
